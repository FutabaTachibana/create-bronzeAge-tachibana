# Create: Bronze Age - tachibana
This project is developed based **on** [Create: Bronze Age](https://github.com/Tors-0/create-bronzeAge) for a modpack that adds bronze and its related components to Create.

While I greatly appreciate the concept of *Create: Bronze* — which has not received updates for a year — I am adapting it to *Minecraft 1.20.1* while expanding its content. The mod provided bronze-based tools, weapons, and equipment through *Create: Bronze*, introduced a bronze tier preceding iron in the tech tree, and implemented enhanced ore processing mechanics.

This project is currently under active development, with an expected release in the near future.

# Create: Bronze Age
This project is still in early development, all features are constantly changing and being updated, so it's recommended to always use the latest version. All alpha versions other than latest are unsupported.

This mod is an addon to the Create mod for 1.19, it aims to expand it by adding a variety of new tools and utilities, focused on Bronze!

Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you through all added mechanics and gadgets.
